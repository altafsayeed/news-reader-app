Live app: https://altafsayeed.github.io/news-reader-app

This is a conversational voice controlled React news application using Alan AI, which is a speech recognition software that allows you to add voice capabilities to your applications. I used Alan AI to create intents, replies, and API requests, and React for everything front-end related. Using your voice, you can tell the app to give you the latest news on certain topics, categories, or even specific keywords. It can also read you the headlines, and open the articles for you. I've always wanted to learn the inner workings of a voice-user interface, and this project allowed me to do that and have fun as well.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
